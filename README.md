Project Overview
This repository contains the software configurations, source code, and supporting documents for the Smart Chessboard project, developed as a final year project in telecommunications engineering. The project aims to enhance traditional chess gameplay with advanced software solutions and AI, providing an interactive and intelligent gaming experience.
Project Description
The Smart Chessboard project leverages software and AI to create an intelligent chessboard that tracks and displays the movement of chess pieces in real-time, as well as providing coaching ability and playing with the AI. The system integrates various sensors and microcontrollers with a robust software interface, enhanced by a chess engine to provide AI-driven gameplay and analysis.
Technologies Used
•	Teensy: For programming the Teensy microcontroller to interface with sensors.
•	Python: For developing the software interface and implementing the AI chess engine.
•	Stockfish: An open-source chess engine used for AI-driven move suggestions and game analysis.
•	Raspberry Pi 4: Used to run the Stockfish engine and manage the overall system.
Files Included
•	Teensy_Code/: Folder containing the source code for the Teensy microcontroller:
o	Smart_Chessboard.ino
o	Various function-oriented C code files.
•	Python_Backend/: Folder with the backend code for managing the chessboard logic and AI integration:
o	app.py
o	chess_logic.py
o	stockfish_integration.py
•	Documentation/: Folder with project documentation and reports:
o	Project_Report.pdf
o	User_Manual.pdf
•	Testing_and_Validation/: Folder with test cases and validation results:
o	Test_Cases.pdf
o	Validation_Results.pdf
Key Features
•	Real-Time Piece Tracking: Utilizes software algorithms to process sensor data and track the position of each chess piece in real-time.
•	AI Integration: Incorporates the Stockfish chess engine to provide AI-driven move suggestions, game analysis, and the ability to play against the computer.
•	Game Data Storage: Implements an SQLite database to store game histories, enabling users to review past games and analyze their moves.
•	Interactive Gameplay: The web application provides an interactive interface for players, including move suggestions and game analysis tools.
•	Extensible Codebase: The project is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy additions and modifications to the software.
Project Outcomes
The Smart Chessboard project successfully demonstrates the integration of software, AI, and hardware to create an intelligent gaming platform. The final product provides a robust and interactive system for playing and analyzing chess games, showcasing the application of software development principles and AI integration in a real-world project.
Conclusion
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and reference for developing a smart chessboard, emphasizing skills in software development, AI integration, database management, and web application design.
